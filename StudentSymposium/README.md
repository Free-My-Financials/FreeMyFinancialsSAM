## Our Experiences

- William
  - It was a very different expereince then other software project presentations I have attended before. I was not at all thinking about the symposium having judges inspecting the presentations, and it made me feel a little more tense then I would have been otherwise. Though I will say it was a little dissapointing that we didn't get more people approaching our team's poster to ask questions, I was somewhat hoping to see more reactions to it.

- Grant
  - I was not able to attend the symposium but it sounds similar to what we did at the banquet. Networking is important to establish a proffessional career and judging allows programs to critically asses their work for improvement. Had I not taken an extra shift to pay for this month's rent I would have attended.
