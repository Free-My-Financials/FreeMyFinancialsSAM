## Topics Discussed
-requirements
    client mentioned addition of tracking "methods" of expense occurring (ex, venmo, cash, check, credit card)
    the system leverages authentication
    the system enforces data integrity
    try this priority: fr11-medium fr9,10-Low--suggestion counter idea, do not do that if users are groups
    Lower idea for functional requirement: trace income and outcome of money based on different methods of spending
-use cases
    client suggested Sub point as an extra actor: Members of the organization who can only VIEW the budgets but cannot edit it
-techstack
    Recommendation for the techstack: get through AWS deployment stragedy soon. It will help reduce the work, new account has a lot free for a year
-domain model
    client asked what the group was thinking about in relation to the idea of transactions and sub-categories, mentioned transactions having multiple broad categories, adding a retail/location/description or other unique signifier for transactions
    Client asked about possibility of tracking goals across multiple budgets from the life of the user
    Client asked if goals would be tied to groups or budgets-responded currently groups are tied to the category, client thinks goals should be able to span multiple budgets (atleast 2)- tied to the group and the category
-Architecture
    overall, client thinks we are on the right track with the architecture design, encouraged us to make use of available tools for some automation
    Amazon allows a lot of api connections to be automated.
-UI prototype
    Feedback: Seeing progress bar is good
-next steps
    client asked where we go from here, and what comes next with the first iteration
    Schedule note, next two weekends are bad for the client, but can still meet in the evening
    

## Things Clarified
-Client wants the program to be as close to serverless as possible
    -serverless defined as: pay as you use model, through amazon. on the demand compute, amazon aurora data base, there is no back end server
-Client questioned the structure, responded that each group may have multiple people and budgets potentially with zero of both
-Client asked if the GUI prototype we provided was an example of one budget, as of the moment that was correct
-Client had no particular preference for task management tools
