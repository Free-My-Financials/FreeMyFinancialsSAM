## Topics Discussed
Fulfilling deadlines: The group had a small discussion that with the upcoming deadlines, we had very little room and need to finish the rest of the design document assignments ASAP.
Domain Model: Created a basic list of classes and connections. There was some confusion on exactly how classes should be linked together. There is some uncertainty on how much we have fully covered, and there will likely be a lot of changes in the future.
Tomorrow meeting: outlined a general time for the next meeting, and decided that meeting needs to end with a UI prototype made, the architecture decided and the techstack decided on.

## Tasks Distributed

Grant - Took up creating a basic outline for the presentation for design day.
