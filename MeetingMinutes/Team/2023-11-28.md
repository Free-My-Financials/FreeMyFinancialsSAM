## Things Clarified

- installing the Nuxt testing utils is a one time action that does not need to be added to the instructions for setting up the Dev environment.
- time is very limited

## Topics Discussed

- How does testing work in nuxt? A significant part of the meeting was focused on figuring out how tests work in our techstack.
- We might have to look for other methods for testing the project, as the Nuxt testing utils are poorly documented and we cannot find information on how to make them work.

## Tasks Distributed

- Jeffery will continue to work on the data base set up
- william will contact Our professor to share concerns about being unable to set up testing
