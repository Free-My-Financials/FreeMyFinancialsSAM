## Topics Discussed
 The scheduling of a client meeting to review design documents. The offered times where Saturday noon to two, and Sunday anytime after one. The Architecture was decided on. A monolith architecture was decided. The Nuxt front end contains and app, which communicates with an authentication module in the backend. This module communicates to a data management module; this is the majority of the application. This module then leaves the backend and communicates with a database to store the revelant information. Work on the prototype also began. It was laid out in a sample user interface for a base screen in figma. Budget tags are given unique colors and bars to associate how much remains of each item. The first screen was finished and a connection to an empty screen was made.

## Tasks Distributed

Dennis was assigned to finish the prototype.
