## Things Clarified

- We have limited time remaining and a lot of paper work todo, it seems most sensible to focus that rather then attempt to add features or polish our ui.
- Deployment for this iteration on githubpages vs netlify. We decided netlify due to its speed to get running for this iteration.

## Topics Discussed

-  Merging Feat 17, the home page update, and deleteTransaction into the dev branch
- We decided to documentation as the main focus for meetings for the rest of the iteration. With the time we have left it just seemed most approriate to get our paper work in order to turn in this iteration.
