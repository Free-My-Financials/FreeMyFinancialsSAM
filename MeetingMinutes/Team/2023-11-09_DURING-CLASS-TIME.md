## Things Clarified

- Not much functional code work is left for this iteration.
- Focus on UI touch ups and documentation updates. 
- The links between the pages of our web app needed to be made more vibily distict form normal text.

## Progress made

- Changed the delete transaction buttons on the history page to a display a trash can icon instead of "delete transaction".
- Color scheme set as shades of green on top of the light mode or dark mode background.
- We created a header bar for the top of all of our pages using Tailwind css to style the header.
- The header bar will change the color of the link for the page you are currently on.
- Fixed an issue where the date of a transaction would be set to a string of numbers by initalizing the date to a empty string and the transaction cannot be submitted without the user properly entering a date.
