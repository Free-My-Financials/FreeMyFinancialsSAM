# For the Future

## Known Issues
- On some instances the print budget/transaction information buttons failed to open the print dialog. We were unable to reproduce the bug, but have a suspicion that it may be due to indiviual broswer configuration settings.
- The ui looks awful in a browser using light mode, often text was near unreadable.

## Future Features

- Enable users to make groups of accounts with varying levels of authority over certain budgets.
- Creation of a mobile companion app to remotely add/edit transactions.
